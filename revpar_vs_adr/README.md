# 📊 Why is RevPAR More Important than ADR?

## 🔍 Overview
This analysis explains the difference between **RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)** and **ADR (Average Daily Rate)** — and why **RevPAR** is the superior performance metric in hotel revenue management.

---

## ✏️ Definitions

| Metric | Formula | What it Tells You |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **ADR** | Room Revenue ÷ Rooms Sold | Average rate earned per sold room |
| **RevPAR** | ADR × Occupancy Rate | Revenue per available room — sold or unsold |

---

## ✅ Why RevPAR > ADR

| Aspect            | ADR                              | RevPAR                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**         | Rate only                        | Rate + Occupancy                            |
| **Blind Spots**   | Ignores unsold rooms             | Captures total performance                  |
| **Manipulability**| Inflated by fewer, high-priced rooms | Balances volume and price               |
| **Strategic Use** | Shows pricing power              | Shows total revenue efficiency              |
| **Forecasting Use** | Less accurate alone             | Stronger KPI for budgeting & planning       |

# 🧩 Segment Mix Strategy

### 🎯 Why It Matters
Optimizing your mix leads to:
- Higher net revenue
- Better forecasting
- Lower acquisition costs

---

## 📌 Steps to Analyze Segment Mix

### 1️⃣ Identify Current Mix
- What % of bookings come from each segment?
- Are you over-relying on one (e.g., OTA)?
- Compare mix across months/seasons.

### 2️⃣ Where to Find It
- **On-the-books** reports (weekly/monthly)
- **PMS dashboards**: Segment ADR, volume, pickup
- **Reservation data**: Source + lead time

### 3️⃣ Optimize Your Mix

| Strategy | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ✅ Direct Growth | Improve conversion & loyalty incentives |
| ✅ Corporate Rates | Re-price underperforming contracts |
| ✅ Group Strategy | Quote seasonal rates, promote value |
| ✅ Control OTA | Limit close-in availability |
